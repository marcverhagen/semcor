"""analyze.py

Some analysis of the wf tags in semcor.

Usage:

$ python3 analyze.py MAXFILES?

The optional argument determines how many files are used for analysis, the
default is to use all files. This assumes that files have been compiled with
semcor.py. Results are printed to standard output and to a file weird-rdfs.txt,
the latter contains some ANSI espace sequences and to see the contents you
should just do a "cat weird-rdfs.txt" (those escape sequences are no good for
Windows or when you want to open the file in an editor, this will be changed at
some point).

There are a couple of funky parts to semcor. One is that the lemma value of
proper names is set to the the entity type. This script analyzes what happens
for those cases, which seems to be that the value of the lemma, pn, and rdf
attributes are all set to the entity type.

However, there are word forms that have an rdf attribute but that are not proper
names. Not sure exactly what they exactly are, but they are printed to the file
weird-rdfs.txt. It should also be noted that those cases are not the same as the
cases where the lemma is different from the actual text of the wf tag, that
group is much bigger (more than half of all forms, it includes all inflections).

TODO:
- add argument to suppress ANSI escape sequences in output file
- analyze what is going on in weird-rdfs.txt
